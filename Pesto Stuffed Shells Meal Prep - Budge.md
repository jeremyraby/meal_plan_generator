# Pesto Stuffed Shells Meal Prep - Budget Bytes

Okay, I’m back to comfort food this week with these Pesto Stuffed Shells Meal Prep. It’s a classic pasta dish that I paired with [Homemade Garlic Bread](https://www.budgetbytes.com/garlic-bread/). I had planned on making it an even more well rounded meal by adding a side of [Vinaigrette Slaw with Feta](https://www.budgetbytes.com/vinaigrette-slaw-with-feta/), but discovered last minute that my cabbage was rotten on the inside. But that’s okay, there’s spinach in my [Pesto Stuffed Shells](https://www.budgetbytes.com/pesto-stuffed-shells/), so it’s not like this meal is void of vegetables. :) I’ll just have to go extra vegetable heavy next week!

Both the Pesto Stuffed Shells recipe and the Homemade Garlic Bread make more than four servings, but the Pesto Stuffed Shells freeze beautifully and I don’t know if you’ll have any problems gobbling up the extra garlic bread (that actually freezes great too, if it makes it that far). ;)

### Notes

* My [Vinaigrette Slaw with Feta](https://www.budgetbytes.com/vinaigrette-slaw-with-feta/) would make an excellent side salad for this meal prep because it’s made out of cabbage, which holds up well in the fridge. The original recipe includes both red and green cabbage, but it’s great with red cabbage only if you don’t want to buy both. I’d probably pack the salad in a separate side container.
* New containers! On advice of many, many readers, I invested in [these Pyrex glass containers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JJILWQ0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1&tag=budgetbytes0d-20). I like that they are wide and shallow, which makes them easy to stuff with multiple items without everything being on top of one another.
* As mentioned above, the Pesto Stuffed Shells freeze really great. Try to scoop up as much of the pasta sauce from the bottom of the casserole dish to top the shells with before freezing because the sauce will help prevent them from drying out.
* Garlic Bread also freezes great. You can freeze the extras before baking, as I did in my [Homemade Freezer Garlic Bread](https://www.budgetbytes.com/homemade-freezer-garlic-bread/) recipe, or freeze it after par-baking if you just want to reheat it briefly in the microwave.

And that’s all I’ve got for you this week, folks! :) Hope you had a great weekend!

# Meal Prep App Ideas

Web app that generates a random weekly meal "plan" in order to both save money and eat a more nutritious diet. Below you can see a checklist of what functionalities I'd like to build and my progress toward completing the project. So far, this project has helped me learn Python syntax and get my feet wet using Python's built-in methods.

## MVP (free)

[X] Randomly generate 1-2 breakfast and lunch meals
[ ] Provides shopping list with prices from Walmart API

[ ] Recipes include food safety instructions
[ ] Recipes include per unit used price breakdown and total cost (<= $3)
[ ] Meals can be prepped and in fridge <= 1 hr
[ ] Recipes are comprised of "staples"

## Extras

[ ] Users pay small monthly fee to add own recipes

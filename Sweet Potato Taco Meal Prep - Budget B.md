# Sweet Potato Taco Meal Prep - Budget Bytes

It’s meal prep time! I’m sorry I didn’t get this post up on Sunday, but a day late is better than never! :) This week I remade and old recipe that I love, [Sweet Potato Tacos](https://www.budgetbytes.com/sweet-potato-tacos-with-lime-crema/), and built my meal prep around that. I also added some [Taco Rice](https://www.budgetbytes.com/easy-taco-rice/) to bulk it out, and some leftover frozen corn that was stashed in the freezer and needed to be used up. I’ve pictured the Sweet Potato Taco Meal Prep two ways below so you can see it both assembled and how you should actually pack them to maintain the best quality.

I used my Taco Rice recipe for this meal prep to keep it vegetarian, but if that’s not a goal you could use [Cilantro Lime Rice](https://www.budgetbytes.com/cilantro-lime-rice/) instead. A little avocado, sliced jalapeño, or even some [Pickled Red Onions](https://www.budgetbytes.com/pickled-red-onions/) would also be awesome in this box. Make it your own!

### Notes

I highly suggest leaving the tacos deconstructed for storage and building the tacos after reheating, to prevent the tortillas from getting soggy. You can reheat the sweet potato/black bean filling, taco rice, and corn all together in the box, leaving the tortillas, lime crema, and lime wedges out of the box while reheating.

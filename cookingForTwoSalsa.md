# MY MOM'S FAMOUS SALSA 
## RECIPE (you are so lucky!) 
I feel like you are so lucky to receive my mom's famous salsa recipe. 
she has been making it for decades, and it's always the most requested 
recipe at any party. It has a bright, fresh taste, all the while relying on 
canned tomatoes, so you can make it year-round. She can't remember 
where she found the original recipe, though most recipes in our family 
start out as Southern Living recipes to which We put our own spin. 
My brother and I have altered the recipe throughout the years— he 
uses serranos instead of jalapefios, and I add chili powder for an extra 
depth of flavor.
### Ingredients 
Yield • 2 cups 
- 1 (14-ounce) can diced tomatoes 
- 1 to 2 jalapeno chiles 
- 1 small purple onion 
- 2 cloves garlic 
- 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 
- 1/2 cup fresh cilantro (stems included) 
- 2 teaspoons chili powder 
- 1 teaspoon salt 
- Tortilla chips, for serving 
### Directions
First, slightly drain off some of the liquid from the 
canned tomatoes—just a tablespoon or two. 
Pour the drained tomatoes into the bowl of a food 
processor.

Chop the jalapenos, removing the seeds and 
white veins to reduce the heat level of the salsa. 
Or leave them whole for an extra-spicy salsa! 
Add the chopped jalapefios to the food processor. 
Peel and roughly chop the onion before adding 
it to the food processor. Add all the remaining 
ingredients, except the tortilla chips, and pulse 
until combined. 

Taste the salsa with a tortilla chip to check for 
saltiness. If it seems to need salt, try adding more 
lime juice first. Always taste salsa with a chip 
because the chips usually have quite a bit of salt 
on them! 

Serve with tortilla chips, or use as a salad dressing 
for my Taco Salad (page 164).
